# Emotion Recognition

The main product of DeepZen is an online web platform providing a text-to-speech solution, focused on delivering emotive speech. Part of this involves analysing the text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to determine a set of emotion parameters to pass in to the speech synthesis pipeline.

Part of my work involved assessing various cutting edge Deep Learning models, ranging from simple LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks, to more complex Transformer based networks. One such project involved trialling the use of BERT, BART, and GPT2 (large transformer based models, of which ChatGPT is the most current iteration).

This was primarily done using PyTorch (a Python framework for Machine Learning), with significant amounts of data manipulation using either Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy, as well as database tools such as SQL and MongoDB (where the data was provided or stored in a database).
